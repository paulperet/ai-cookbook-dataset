# Fine-tuning a Code LLM on Custom Code on a single GPU

_Authored by: [Maria Khalusova](https://github.com/MKhalusova)_

Publicly available code LLMs such as Codex, StarCoder, and Code Llama are great at generating code that adheres to general programming principles and syntax, but they may not align with an organization's internal conventions, or be aware of proprietary libraries.

In this notebook, we'll see show how you can fine-tune a code LLM on private code bases to enhance its contextual awareness and improve a model's usefulness to your organization's needs. Since the code LLMs are quite large, fine-tuning them in a traditional manner can be resource-draining. Worry not! We will show how you can optimize fine-tuning to fit on a single GPU.

## Dataset

For this example, we picked the top 10 Hugging Face public repositories on GitHub. We have excluded non-code files from the data, such as images, audio files, presentations, and so on. For Jupyter notebooks, we've kept only cells containing code. The resulting code is stored as a dataset that you can find on the Hugging Face Hub under [`smangrul/hf-stack-v1`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/smangrul/hf-stack-v1). It contains repo id, file path, and file content.

## Model

We'll finetune [`bigcode/starcoderbase-1b`](https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoderbase-1b), which is a 1B parameter model trained on 80+ programming languages. This is a gated model, so if you plan to run this notebook with this exact model, you'll need to gain access to it on the model's page. Log in to your Hugging Face account to do so:

```python
from huggingface_hub import notebook_login

notebook_login()
```

To get started, let's install all the necessary libraries. As you can see, in addition to `transformers` and `datasets`, we'll be using `peft`, `bitsandbytes`, and `flash-attn` to optimize the training.

By employing parameter-efficient training techniques, we can run this notebook on a single A100 High-RAM GPU.

```python
!pip install -q transformers datasets peft bitsandbytes flash-attn
```

Let's define some variables now. Feel free to play with these.

    AutoTokenizer,
    Trainer,
    TrainingArguments,
    logging,
    set_seed,
    BitsAndBytesConfig,
)

set_seed(SEED)
```

## Prepare the data

Begin by loading the data. As the dataset is likely to be quite large, make sure to enable the streaming mode. Streaming allows us to load the data progressively as we iterate over the dataset instead of downloading the whole dataset at once.

We'll reserve the first 4000 examples as the validation set, and everything else will be the training data.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
import torch
from tqdm import tqdm


dataset = load_dataset(
    DATASET,
    data_dir="data",
    split="train",
    streaming=True,
)

valid_data = dataset.take(4000)
train_data = dataset.skip(4000)
train_data = train_data.shuffle(buffer_size=5000, seed=SEED)
```

At this step, the dataset still contains raw data with code of arbitraty length. For training, we need inputs of fixed length. Let's create an Iterable dataset that would return constant-length chunks of tokens from a stream of text files.

First, let's estimate the average number of characters per token in the dataset, which will help us later estimate the number of tokens in the text buffer later. By default, we'll only take 400 examples (`nb_examples`) from the dataset. Using only a subset of the entire dataset will reduce computational cost while still providing a reasonable estimate of the overall character-to-token ratio.

```python
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL, trust_remote_code=True)

def chars_token_ratio(dataset, tokenizer, data_column, nb_examples=400):
    """
    Estimate the average number of characters per token in the dataset.
    """

    total_characters, total_tokens = 0, 0
    for _, example in tqdm(zip(range(nb_examples), iter(dataset)), total=nb_examples):
        total_characters += len(example[data_column])
        total_tokens += len(tokenizer(example[data_column]).tokens())

    return total_characters / total_tokens


chars_per_token = chars_token_ratio(train_data, tokenizer, DATA_COLUMN)
print(f"The character to token ratio of the dataset is: {chars_per_token:.2f}")
```

The character-to-token ratio can also be used as an indicator of the quality of text tokenization. For instance, a character-to-token ratio of 1.0 would mean that each character is represented with a token, which is not very meaningful. This would indicate poor tokenization. In standard English text, one token is typically equivalent to approximately four characters, meaning the character-to-token ratio is around 4.0. We can expect a lower ratio in the code dataset, but generally speaking, a number between 2.0 and 3.5 can be considered good enough.

**Optional FIM transformations**

Autoregressive language models typically generate sequences from left to right. By applying the FIM transformations, the model can also learn to infill text.  Check out ["Efficient Training of Language Models to Fill in the Middle" paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.14255.pdf) to learn more about the technique.
We'll define the FIM transformations here and will use them when creating the Iterable Dataset. However, if you want to omit transformations, feel free to set `fim_rate` to 0.

```python
import functools
import numpy as np


# Helper function to get token ids of the special tokens for prefix, suffix and middle for FIM transformations.
@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def get_fim_token_ids(tokenizer):
    try:
        FIM_PREFIX, FIM_MIDDLE, FIM_SUFFIX, FIM_PAD = tokenizer.special_tokens_map["additional_special_tokens"][1:5]
        suffix_tok_id, prefix_tok_id, middle_tok_id, pad_tok_id = (
            tokenizer.vocab[tok] for tok in [FIM_SUFFIX, FIM_PREFIX, FIM_MIDDLE, FIM_PAD]
        )
    except KeyError:
        suffix_tok_id, prefix_tok_id, middle_tok_id, pad_tok_id = None, None, None, None
    return suffix_tok_id, prefix_tok_id, middle_tok_id, pad_tok_id

        boundaries.sort()

        prefix = np.array(sample[: boundaries[0]], dtype=np.int64)

Let's define the `ConstantLengthDataset`, an Iterable dataset that will return constant-length chunks of tokens. To do so, we'll read a buffer of text from the original dataset until we hit the size limits and then apply tokenizer to convert the raw text into tokenized inputs. Optionally, we'll perform FIM transformations on some sequences (the proportion of sequences affected is controlled by `fim_rate`).

Once defined, we can create instances of the `ConstantLengthDataset` from both training and validation data.

```python
from torch.utils.data import IterableDataset
from torch.utils.data.dataloader import DataLoader
import random

# Create an Iterable dataset that returns constant length chunks of tokens from a stream of text files.

class ConstantLengthDataset(IterableDataset):
    """

## Prepare the model

Now that the data is prepared, it's time to load the model! We're going to load the quantized version of the model.

This will allow us to reduce memory usage, as quantization represents data with fewer bits. We'll use the `bitsandbytes` library to quantize the model, as it has a nice integration with `transformers`. All we need to do is define a `bitsandbytes` config, and then use it when loading the model.

There are different variants of 4bit quantization, but generally, we recommend using NF4 quantization for better performance (`bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4"`).

The `bnb_4bit_use_double_quant` option adds a second quantization after the first one to save an additional 0.4 bits per parameter.

To learn more about quantization, check out the ["Making LLMs even more accessible with bitsandbytes, 4-bit quantization and QLoRA" blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes).

Once defined, pass the config to the `from_pretrained` method to load the quantized version of the model.

```python
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model, prepare_model_for_kbit_training
from peft.tuners.lora import LoraLayer

load_in_8bit = False

# 4-bit quantization
compute_dtype = getattr(torch, BNB_4BIT_COMPUTE_DTYPE)

bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",
    bnb_
