# How to transcribe documents with Claude

Claude 3 is great at reading unstructured text and information within images and PDFs and turning it into structured text. We'll take a look at a few examples but first let's setup the code we need to run the notebook.

```python
%pip install anthropic IPython
```

```python
import base64

from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic()
MODEL_NAME = "claude-opus-4-1"


def get_base64_encoded_image(image_path):
    with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
        binary_data = image_file.read()
        base_64_encoded_data = base64.b64encode(binary_data)
        base64_string = base_64_encoded_data.decode("utf-8")
        return base64_string
```

## Transcribing typed text

The advantage of using Claude 3 over traditional OCR systems is that you can specify exactly what you want to transcribe due to Claude 3's advanced reasoning capabilities. For this image, let’s transcribe just the code in the answer.

```python
message_list = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "source": {
                    "type": "base64",
                    "media_type": "image/png",
                    "data": get_base64_encoded_image("../images/transcribe/stack_overflow.png"),
                },
            },
            {"type": "text", "text": "Transcribe the code in the answer. Only output the code."},
        ],
    }
]

response = client.messages.create(model=MODEL_NAME, max_tokens=2048, messages=message_list)
print(response.content[0].text)
```

    import os
    import base64
    
    image = 'test.jpg'
    
    encoded_string = ""
    with open(image, "rb") as image_file:
        encoded_string = base64.b64encode(image_file.read())
    file = encoded_string

## Transcribing handwritten text

That's good but let's try something a little harder. Claude 3 excels at transcribing handwritten text as well. Let's ask Claude 3 to transcribe this handwritten prescription note.

```python
message_list = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "source": {
                    "type": "base64",
                    "media_type": "image/png",
                    "data": get_base64_encoded_image("../images/transcribe/school_notes.png"),
                },
            },
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "Transcribe this text. Only output the text and nothing else.",
            },
        ],
    }
]

response = client.messages.create(model=MODEL_NAME, max_tokens=2048, messages=message_list)
print(response.content[0].text)
```

    Levels of Cellular Organization
    1) Cells group together to make tissue.
    2) Tissues group together to make an organ.
    3) Organs group together to make an organ system
    4) Organ systems group together to make an organism
    
    Organism -> a living thing that can
    carry out life processes by itself.
    
    - Multicellular organisms have specialized
    cells to perform specific functions.
    > This makes them more efficient
    and typically have a longer life span.
    
    Tissue = a group of similar cells
    that perform a common function.
    1) Animals are made of four
    basic types of tissue
    > nervous, epithelial, connective,
    and muscle
    2) Plants have three types
    of tissue
    > transport, protective, and
    ground

## Transcribing forms
How about we try a combination of typed and handwritten text? This is common across a variety of documents like insurance and report forms.

```python
message_list = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "source": {
                    "type": "base64",
                    "media_type": "image/jpeg",
                    "data": get_base64_encoded_image("../images/transcribe/vehicle_form.jpg"),
                },
            },
            {"type": "text", "text": "Transcribe this form exactly."},
        ],
    }
]

response = client.messages.create(model=MODEL_NAME, max_tokens=2048, messages=message_list)
print(response.content[0].text)
```

## Complicated document QA
With Claude 3 we can go beyond just transcription and ask specific questions about our information in our unstructured documents.

```python
message_list = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "source": {
                    "type": "base64",
                    "media_type": "image/jpeg",
                    "data": get_base64_encoded_image("../images/transcribe/page.jpeg"),
                },
            },
            {"type": "text", "text": "Which is the most critical issue for live rep support?"},
        ],
    }
]

response = client.messages.create(model=MODEL_NAME, max_tokens=2048, messages=message_list)
print(response.content[0].text)
```

    According to the hierarchy of importance pyramid for Live Rep Support shown in the image, the most critical issue is Product Quality/Liability Issues. This is positioned at the very bottom of the pyramid, indicating it is the most critical or important issue for live rep support to handle.

## Unstructured information -> JSON

Let's take a look at how you can use Claude to turn unstructured information in an image into a structured JSON output.

```python
message_list = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "source": {
                    "type": "base64",
                    "media_type": "image/jpeg",
                    "data": get_base64_encoded_image("../images/transcribe/org_chart.jpeg"),
                },
            },
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "Turn this org chart into JSON indicating who reports to who. Only output the JSON and nothing else.",
            },
        ],
    }
]

response = client.messages.create(model=MODEL_NAME, max_tokens=2048, messages=message_list)
print(response.content[0].text)
```

        ]
