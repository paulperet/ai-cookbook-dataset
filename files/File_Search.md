# File Search Quickstart

The [File Search tool](http://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/file-search) allows you to build powerful retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications using Gemini. It lets you upload documents to a managed store and then use them as a tool during model generation, enabling Gemini to answer questions based on your specific data with accurate citations.

In this quickstart, you will learn how to:

*   Create a File Search Store.
*   Upload documents to the store.
*   Use the store as a tool in `generate_content`.
*   Cite the sources used during generation.
*   Filter search results using custom metadata.
*   Manage your documents and stores.

For information on how pricing works for File Search, including details on what is available free of charge, see the [pricing information](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/file-search#pricing).

## Install dependencies

First, install the Google Gen AI SDK.



```
# SDK 1.49 introduced File Search
%pip install -U -q 'google-genai>=1.49.0'
```

### Authentication

**Important:** The File Search API uses API keys for authentication and access. Uploaded files are associated with the API key's cloud project. Unlike other Gemini APIs that use API keys, your API key also grants access to all data you've uploaded to file stores, so take extra care in keeping your API key secure. For best practices on securing API keys, refer to Google's [documentation](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6310037).

#### Set up your API key

To run the following cell, your API key must be stored in a Colab Secret named `GEMINI_API_KEY`. If you don't already have an API key, or you're not sure how to create a Colab Secret, see [Authentication](./Authentication.ipynb) for an example.


```
from google import genai
from google.colab import userdata
from google.genai import types

GEMINI_API_KEY = userdata.get("GEMINI_API_KEY")
client = genai.Client(api_key=GEMINI_API_KEY)
```

## Basic file search

In this section, you will download a sample document, create a File Search Store, and use it to answer questions.

### Create a File Search Store

Create a new File Search Store to hold your documents.



```
file_search_store = client.file_search_stores.create(
    config=types.CreateFileSearchStoreConfig(
        display_name='My File Search Store'
    )
)

print(f"Created store: {file_search_store.name}")
```

    Created store: fileSearchStores/my-file-search-store-9fimh45e9q14


### Download a sample document

Download "A Survey of Modernist Poetry" from Project Gutenberg as a sample text file.


```
!wget -q https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/76401/pg76401.txt -O sample_poetry.txt
!head sample_poetry.txt
```

    ﻿The Project Gutenberg eBook of A survey of modernist poetry
        
    This ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
    most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this ebook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the United States,
    you will have to check the laws of the country where you are located
    before using this eBook.
    


### Upload a file to the store

Upload the text file directly to the store. The ingestion process includes some processing, so you need to wait for it to complete before you can search.


```
import time

upload_op = client.file_search_stores.upload_to_file_search_store(
    file_search_store_name=file_search_store.name,
    file='sample_poetry.txt',
    config=types.UploadToFileSearchStoreConfig(
        display_name='A Survey of Modernist Poetry',
    )
)

print(f"Upload started: {upload_op.name}")


while not (upload_op := client.operations.get(upload_op)).done:
    time.sleep(1)
    print(".", end="")

print()
print("Processing complete.")
```

    Upload started: fileSearchStores/my-file-search-store-9fimh45e9q14/upload/operations/a-survey-of-modernist-poetr-rd7al7895r59
    [..., ..., ...]
    Processing complete.


### Alternative: Import from the File API

If you have already uploaded documents to the [File API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/files), you can import them directly into a File Store. This may be helpful if a user has performed some interaction with a file already, such as generating a summary, and has approved the file for use in a store.


```
file_ref = client.files.upload(
    file='sample_poetry.txt',
    config=types.UploadFileConfig(
        display_name='A Survey of Modernist Poetry',
        mime_type='text/plain',
    )
)
print(f"Uploaded via File API: {file_ref.name}")

import_op = client.file_search_stores.import_file(
    file_search_store_name=file_search_store.name,
    file_name=file_ref.name,
)

print(f"File import started: {import_op.name}")

while not (import_op := client.operations.get(import_op)).done:
    time.sleep(1)
    print(".", end="")

print()
print("Processing complete.")
```

    Uploaded via File API: files/li0pn1it912i
    File import started: fileSearchStores/my-file-search-store-9fimh45e9q14/operations/li0pn1it912i-ucqsutd9emb1
    [..., ..., ..., ...]
    Processing complete.


### Generate content with File Search

Now, use the `file_search` tool in a `generate_content` request. Gemini will use the uploaded document to answer your question.



```
MODEL_ID = "gemini-3-flash-preview" # @param ["gemini-2.5-flash-lite", "gemini-2.5-flash", "gemini-2.5-pro", "gemini-2.5-flash-preview", "gemini-3-pro-preview"] {"allow-input":true, isTemplate: true}

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    contents='What does the text say about E.E. Cummings?',
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        tools=[types.Tool(
            file_search=types.FileSearch(
                file_search_store_names=[file_search_store.name],
            )
        )]
    )
)

print(response.text)
```

    The text discusses E.E. Cummings as a significant poet whose work demands a "more vigorous imaginative effort" from the reader than what is typically applied to poetry. His innovations are considered to have a real place in the normal course of poetry-writing, and his acceptance is suggested, if not for his own sake, then for his potential effect on the future reading of poetry of any age or style.
    
    One of Cummings' earlier and simpler poems is chosen for analysis in the text, despite its potential to elicit hostility similar to his later work. This particular poem is noted for its suitability for analysis, as it addresses a subject matter that the "plain reader" often seeks in poetry. It also appears in Mr. Louis Untermeyer's "Anthology of Modern American Poetry" alongside poets who are more willing to cater to the plain reader's intelligence level.
    
    The text further suggests that Cummings writes according to a carefully constructed poetic system, but he refrains from providing a critical key to his poems, except as a "semi-prefatorial confidence." This implies that as poems become more independent, the need or sense for a technical guide diminishes. The increasing difficulty of poems would not necessarily hinder understanding but rather make the reader less separated from poetry by technique.
    
    Regarding his use of punctuation, the text describes punctuation marks in Cummings' poetry as "bolts and axels" that make the poem a "methodic and fool-proof piece of machinery" that requires common sense rather than imagination for its operation. The strong reaction against his typography highlights the difficulty in engaging a reader's common sense as much as their imagination.
    
    The text concludes by suggesting that while future poems might not all be written "in the Cummings way," his poetry is important as a "sign of local irritation in the poetic body" rather than a model for a new tradition. It emphasizes the need to highlight the differences between good and bad poems to the reading public, especially during a time of popular but superficial education.


#### Additional fields

The `FileSearch` tool provides some options for configuring how the tool works, `top_k` and `metadata_filter`.

`top_k` controls how many chunks will be returned from the search tool and passed to the generation step. This is the same example as before, but only 1 chunk will be used to generate the answer. This control can be helpful to guide the model if you know there is only one correct chunk to consider (`k=1`), or if you expect the chunks to have more overlap and you want to include more context (higher `top_k`).

Metadata filtering is described in the next section, and you can find the full spec in the [API reference](https://ai.google.dev/api/caching#FileSearch).


```
top_K = 1 # @param {"allow-input":true, isTemplate: true}

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    contents='What does the text say about E.E. Cummings?',
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        tools=[types.Tool(
            file_search=types.FileSearch(
                file_search_store_names=[file_search_store.name],
                top_k=top_K,
            )
        )]
    )
)

print(response.text)
```

### Inspect grounding metadata

The response includes `grounding_metadata` which contains citations and references to the source document. The document chunks used in the generation context are available in `grounding_metadata.grounding_chunks`, and look like this.

```python
[
  GroundingChunk(
    retrieved_context=GroundingChunkRetrievedContext(
      text="""(the snippet of text contained in this chunk)""",
      title='(the title of the document)'
    )
  ), ...
]
```


```
import textwrap

grounding = response.candidates[0].grounding_metadata

if grounding and grounding.grounding_chunks:
    print(f"Found {len(grounding.grounding_chunks)} grounding chunks.")
    for i, chunk in enumerate(grounding.grounding_chunks, start=1):
        print(f"\nChunk {i} source: {chunk.retrieved_context.title}")
        print("Chunk text:")
        print(textwrap.indent(chunk.retrieved_context.text[:150] + "...", "  "))
else:
    print("No grounding metadata found.")
```

    Found 5 grounding chunks.

Additionally, `grounding_metadata` includes `grounding_supports` that provide references from the response text to the supporting documents, and can be used for providing annotations.

The supports look like this.

```python
[
  GroundingSupport(
    grounding_chunk_indices=[
      0,  # The index in `grounding_chunks` to which this corresponds
    ],
    segment=Segment(
      start_index=123,  # Indices into the generated text
      end_index=456,
      text='(the span of generated text being supported)'
    )
  ), ...
]
```


```
from IPython.display import Markdown, display

# Accumulate the response as it is annotated.
annotated_response_parts = []

if not grounding or not grounding.grounding_supports:
    print("No grounding metadata or supports found for annotation.")
else:
    cursor = 0
    for support in grounding.grounding_supports:
        # Add the text before the current support
        annotated_response_parts.append(response.text[cursor:support.segment.start_index])

        # Construct the superscript citation from chunk IDs
        chunk_ids = ', '.join(map(str, support.grounding_chunk_indices))
        citation = f"<sup>{chunk_ids}</sup>"

        # Append the formatted, cited, supported text
        annotated_response_parts.append(f"**{support.segment.text}**{citation}")

        cursor = support.segment.end_index

    # Append any remaining text after the last support
    annotated_response_parts.append(response.text[cursor:])

    final_annotated_response = "".join(annotated_response_parts)
    display(Markdown(final_annotated_response))

```

## Metadata Filtering

While adding documents, you can attach custom metadata to your files and use it to filter search results.

### Upload a file with metadata

Download another book, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", and upload it with information about genre and author.


```
!wget -q https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt -O alice_in_wonderland.txt
!head alice_in_wonderland.txt
```

    *** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 11 ***
    
    [Illustration]
    
    
    
    
    Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland
    
    by Lewis Carroll



```
upload_op = client.file_search_stores.upload_to_file_search_store(
    file_search_store_name=file_search_store.name,
    file='alice_in_wonderland.txt',
    config=types.UploadToFileSearchStoreConfig(
        display_name='Alice in Wonderland',
        custom_metadata=[
            types.CustomMetadata(key='genre', string_value='fiction'),
            types.CustomMetadata(key='author', string_value='Lewis Carroll'),
        ]
    )
)

while not (upload_op := client.operations.get(upload_op)).done:
    time.sleep(1)
    print(".", end="")

print()
print("Upload complete.")
```

    [..., ...]
    Upload complete.


Custom metadata can be provided as `string_value`, `numeric_value` or `string_list_value` types.


```
types.CustomMetadata.model_fields.keys() - {'key'}
```




    {'numeric_value', 'string_list_value', 'string_value'}



### Query with metadata filter

Now, ask a question that could apply to either book, but use a filter to restrict it to just one. For example, ask about a "Queen" but filter for 'fiction'.



```
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    contents='Who is the Queen?',
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        tools=[types.Tool(
            file_search=types.FileSearch(
                file_search_store_names=[file_search_store.name],
                metadata_filter='genre = "fiction"'
            )
        )]
    )
)

print(response.text)
print('-' * 80)

if grounding := response.candidates[0].grounding_metadata:
  unique_titles = {c.retrieved_context.title for c in grounding.ground
