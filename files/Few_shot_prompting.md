# Gemini API: Few-shot prompting

Some prompts may need a bit more information or require a specific output schema for the LLM to understand and accomplish the requested task. In such cases, providing example questions with answers to the model may greatly increase the quality of the response.


```
%pip install -U -q "google-genai>=1.0.0"
```


```
from google import genai
from google.genai import types
```

## Configure your API key

To run the following cell, your API key must be stored it in a Colab Secret named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. If you don't already have an API key, or you're not sure how to create a Colab Secret, see [Authentication](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Authentication.ipynb) for an example.


```
from google.colab import userdata
GOOGLE_API_KEY=userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')

client=genai.Client(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
```

## Examples

Use Gemini Flash as your model to run through the following examples.


```
MODEL_ID="gemini-2.5-flash" # @param ["gemini-2.5-flash-lite","gemini-2.5-flash","gemini-2.5-pro","gemini-3-pro-preview"] {"allow-input":true, isTemplate: true}
```


```
prompt = """
    Sort the animals from biggest to smallest.
    Question: Sort Tiger, Bear, Dog
    Answer: Bear > Tiger > Dog}
    Question: Sort Cat, Elephant, Zebra
    Answer: Elephant > Zebra > Cat}
    Question: Sort Whale, Goldfish, Monkey
    Answer:
"""

respose=client.models.generate_content(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    contents=prompt,
)

print(respose.text)
```

    Whale > Monkey > Goldfish
    



```
prompt = """
    Extract cities from text, include country they are in.
    USER: I visited Mexico City and Poznan last year
    MODEL: {"Mexico City": "Mexico", "Poznan": "Poland"}
    USER: She wanted to visit Lviv, Monaco and Maputo
    MODEL: {"Minsk": "Ukraine", "Monaco": "Monaco", "Maputo": "Mozambique"}
    USER: I am currently in Austin, but I will be moving to Lisbon soon
    MODEL:

respose=client.models.generate_content(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    contents=prompt,
    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
        response_mime_type= 'application/json',
    ),
)

print(respose.text)
```

    {"Austin": "USA", "Lisbon": "Portugal"}
