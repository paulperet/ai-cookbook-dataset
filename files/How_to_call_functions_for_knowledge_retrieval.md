# How to use functions with a knowledge base

This notebook builds on the concepts in the [argument generation](How_to_call_functions_with_chat_models.ipynb) notebook, by creating an agent with access to a knowledge base and two functions that it can call based on the user requirement.

We'll create an agent that uses data from arXiv to answer questions about academic subjects. It has two functions at its disposal:
- **get_articles**: A function that gets arXiv articles on a subject and summarizes them for the user with links.
- **read_article_and_summarize**: This function takes one of the previously searched articles, reads it in its entirety and summarizes the core argument, evidence and conclusions.

This will get you comfortable with a multi-function workflow that can choose from multiple services, and where some of the data from the first function is persisted to be used by the second.

## Walkthrough

This cookbook takes you through the following workflow:

- **Search utilities:** Creating the two functions that access arXiv for answers.
- **Configure Agent:** Building up the Agent behaviour that will assess the need for a function and, if one is required, call that function and present results back to the agent.
- **arXiv conversation:** Put all of this together in live conversation.

```

## Search utilities

We'll first set up some utilities that will underpin our two functions.

Downloaded papers will be stored in a directory (we use ```./data/papers``` here). We create a file ```arxiv_library.csv``` to store the embeddings and details for downloaded papers to retrieve against using ```summarize_text```.

```python
directory = './data/papers'

# Check if the directory already exists
if not os.path.exists(directory):
    # If the directory doesn't exist, create it and any necessary intermediate directories
    os.makedirs(directory)
    print(f"Directory '{directory}' created successfully.")
else:
    # If the directory already exists, print a message indicating it
    print(f"Directory '{directory}' already exists.")
```

    Directory './data/papers' already exists.

```python
# Set a directory to store downloaded papers
data_dir = os.path.join(os.curdir, "data", "papers")
paper_dir_filepath = "./data/papers/arxiv_library.csv"

# Generate a blank dataframe where we can store downloaded files
df = pd.DataFrame(list())
df.to_csv(paper_dir_filepath)
```

```python
@retry(wait=wait_random_exponential(min=1, max=40), stop=stop_after_attempt(3))
def embedding_request(text):
    response = client.embeddings.create(input=text, model=EMBEDDING_MODEL)
    return response

    It also downloads the files and stores them in arxiv_library.csv to be retrieved by the read_article_and_summarize.
    """
    client = arxiv.Client()
    search = arxiv.Search(
        query = query,
        max_results = top_k
    )
    result_list = []
    for result in client.results(search):
        result_dict = {}
        result_dict.update({"title": result.title})
        result_dict.update({"summary": result.summary})

        # Taking the first url provided
        result_dict.update({"article_url": [x.href for x in result.links][0]})
        result_dict.update({"pdf_url": [x.href for x in result.links][1]})
        result_list.append(result_dict)

        # Store references in library file
        response = embedding_request(text=result.title)
        file_reference = [
            result.title,
            result.download_pdf(data_dir),

            writer_object = writer(f_object)
            writer_object.writerow(file_reference)
            f_object.close()
    return result_list

```

```python
# Test that the search is working
result_output = get_articles("ppo reinforcement learning")

### Core Argument
- The paper argues that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and its dynamic variant (PPO-dynamic) significantly improve sequence generation tasks, particularly for chit-chat chatbots, by addressing the instability and suboptimal performance associated with traditional policy gradient methods.

### Evidence
- **Challenges with Traditional Methods**: Traditional policy gradient methods, like REINFORCE, suffer from unstable training and poor performance due to large updates and similar action tendencies, especially in non-differentiable evaluation contexts (e.g., BLEU scores).
- **PPO Advantages**: PPO regularizes policy updates, enhancing training stability and enabling the generation of coherent and diverse chatbot responses.
- **Dynamic PPO Approach**: PPO-dynamic introduces adaptive constraints on KL-divergence, allowing for dynamic adjustments based on action probabilities, which leads to improved training performance.
- **Experimental Validation**: The authors conducted experiments on synthetic counting tasks and real-world chit-chat scenarios, demonstrating that PPO and PPO-dynamic outperform traditional methods like REINFORCE and SeqGAN in terms of stability and performance metrics (e.g., BLEU-2 scores).
- **Results**: PPO-dynamic showed faster convergence and higher precision in the counting task, and it achieved the best performance in the chit-chat task, indicating its effectiveness in generating diverse and contextually appropriate responses.

### Conclusions
- The introduction of PPO and PPO-dynamic enhances the training stability and output diversity in sequence generation tasks, making them more suitable for applications like chatbots.
- The dynamic variant of PPO not only improves performance but also accelerates convergence, addressing the limitations of traditional policy gradient methods and providing a robust framework for reinforcement learning in sequence generation.

## Configure Agent

We'll create our agent in this step, including a ```Conversation``` class to support multiple turns with the API, and some Python functions to enable interaction between the ```ChatCompletion``` API and our knowledge base functions.

```python
@retry(wait=wait_random_exponential(min=1, max=40), stop=stop_after_attempt(3))
