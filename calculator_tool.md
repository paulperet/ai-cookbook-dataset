# Using a Calculator Tool with Claude
In this recipe, we'll demonstrate how to provide Claude with a simple calculator tool that it can use to perform arithmetic operations based on user input. We'll define the calculator tool and show how Claude can interact with it to solve mathematical problems.

## Step 1: Set up the environment

First, let's install the required libraries and set up the Claude API client.

```python
%pip install anthropic
```

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic()
MODEL_NAME = "claude-opus-4-1"
```

## Step 2: Define the calculator tool
We'll define a simple calculator tool that can perform basic arithmetic operations. The tool will take a mathematical expression as input and return the result. 

Note that we are calling ```eval``` on the outputted expression. This is bad practice and should not be used generally but we are doing it for the purpose of demonstration.

```python
import re


def calculate(expression):
    # Remove any non-digit or non-operator characters from the expression
    expression = re.sub(r"[^0-9+\-*/().]", "", expression)

    try:
        # Evaluate the expression using the built-in eval() function
        # Note: eval is used here for demonstration purposes only.
        # In production, use a safer alternative like ast.literal_eval or a math parser.
        result = eval(expression)  # noqa: S307
        return str(result)
    except (SyntaxError, ZeroDivisionError, NameError, TypeError, OverflowError):
        return "Error: Invalid expression"


tools = [
    {
        "name": "calculator",
        "description": "A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.",
        "input_schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "expression": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The mathematical expression to evaluate (e.g., '2 + 3 * 4').",
                }
            },
            "required": ["expression"],
        },
    }
]
```

In this example, we define a calculate function that takes a mathematical expression as input, removes any non-digit or non-operator characters using a regular expression, and then evaluates the expression using the built-in eval() function. If the evaluation is successful, the result is returned as a string. If an error occurs during evaluation, an error message is returned.

We then define the calculator tool with an input schema that expects a single expression property of type string.

## Step 3: Interact with Claude
Now, let's see how Claude can interact with the calculator tool to solve mathematical problems.

```python
def process_tool_call(tool_name, tool_input):
    if tool_name == "calculator":
        return calculate(tool_input["expression"])


def chat_with_claude(user_message):
    print(f"\n{'=' * 50}\nUser Message: {user_message}\n{'=' * 50}")

    message = client.messages.create(
        model=MODEL_NAME,
        max_tokens=4096,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_message}],
        tools=tools,
    )

    print("\nInitial Response:")
    print(f"Stop Reason: {message.stop_reason}")
    print(f"Content: {message.content}")

    if message.stop_reason == "tool_use":
        tool_use = next(block for block in message.content if block.type == "tool_use")
        tool_name = tool_use.name
        tool_input = tool_use.input

        print(f"\nTool Used: {tool_name}")
        print(f"Tool Input: {tool_input}")

        tool_result = process_tool_call(tool_name, tool_input)

        print(f"Tool Result: {tool_result}")

        response = client.messages.create(
            model=MODEL_NAME,
            max_tokens=4096,
            messages=[
                {"role": "user", "content": user_message},
                {"role": "assistant", "content": message.content},
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": [
                        {
                            "type": "tool_result",
                            "tool_use_id": tool_use.id,
                            "content": tool_result,
                        }
                    ],
                },
            ],
            tools=tools,
        )
    else:
        response = message

    final_response = next(
        (block.text for block in response.content if hasattr(block, "text")),
        None,
    )
    print(response.content)
    print(f"\nFinal Response: {final_response}")

    return final_response
```

## Step 4: Try it out!

Let's try giving Claude a few example math questions now that it has access to a calculator.

```python
chat_with_claude("What is the result of 1,984,135 * 9,343,116?")
chat_with_claude("Calculate (12851 - 593) * 301 + 76")
chat_with_claude("What is 15910385 divided by 193053?")
```

[Initial Response: Stop Reason: tool_use, ..., Final Response: So 15910385 divided by 193053 equals 82.41459599177428.]
