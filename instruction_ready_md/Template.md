# Getting Started with the Gemini API

This guide provides a foundational tutorial for using the Google Gemini API. You will learn how to set up your environment, authenticate with the API, and make your first generative AI call. This is the perfect starting point for developers new to the Gemini platform.

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you will need:
*   A Google AI API key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
*   Basic familiarity with Python.

## Setup

### 1. Install the Python SDK
First, install the official `google-genai` Python SDK. Run the following command in your terminal or notebook cell.

```bash
pip install -U -q "google-genai>=1.0.0"
```

### 2. Configure Your API Key
Store your API key securely. In a Colab environment, you can use Colab Secrets. In other environments, use environment variables.

```python
# Example for Google Colab
from google.colab import userdata
from google import genai

GOOGLE_API_KEY = userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')
client = genai.Client(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
```

### 3. Select a Model
Choose a Gemini model for this tutorial. We'll use `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` for its speed and general availability.

```python
MODEL_ID = "gemini-2.0-flash-exp"
```

## Your First API Call

Now, let's make a simple call to the Gemini API to generate content.

### Step 1: Import the Client
Ensure you have imported the `genai` module and initialized the client as shown in the setup section.

### Step 2: Generate Content
Use the `client.models.generate_content` method to send a prompt to the model. We'll ask it to explain a concept simply.

```python
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    contents="Explain how a neural network works in one sentence."
)
```

### Step 3: Print the Response
The model's response is contained within the returned object. Let's extract and print the text.

```python
print(response.text)
```

You should see a concise, one-sentence explanation of neural networks generated by the model.
