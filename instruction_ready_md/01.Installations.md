# Lab 0: Environment Setup Guide

Welcome to the hands-on labs! Before we begin building AI workflows, we need to set up a consistent development environment. This guide will walk you through installing all necessary tools and dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Windows (PowerShell commands are provided)
- **Administrator Access**: Required for some installations
- **Internet Connection**: Needed to download packages

## Step 1: Set Up Python Environment

We'll use Miniforge to manage our Python environment, which provides a lightweight alternative to Anaconda.

1. **Install Miniforge**:
   - Visit the [Miniforge GitHub repository](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)
   - Download and install the appropriate version for your system

2. **Create Python 3.11 Environment**:
   Open PowerShell and run:

   ```bash
   conda create -n pyenv python==3.11.8 -y
   conda activate pyenv
   ```

## Step 2: Install Prompt Flow SDK

Prompt Flow is a development tool for creating, testing, and deploying AI workflows. We'll use it extensively in Lab 1.

1. **Install the SDK**:

   ```bash
   pip install promptflow --upgrade
   ```

2. **Verify Installation**:

   ```bash
   pf --version
   ```

   This should display the installed version of Prompt Flow.

## Step 3: Install Visual Studio Code Extension

For the best development experience, install the Prompt Flow extension in VS Code:

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Prompt Flow"
4. Install the Microsoft-provided extension

## Step 4: Set Up Intel NPU Acceleration (Optional)

If you have an Intel processor with Neural Processing Unit (NPU) support, you can accelerate local LLM/SLM inference.

1. **Install the NPU Library**:

   ```bash
   pip install intel-npu-acceleration-library
   ```

2. **Version Compatibility Note**:
   This library requires Transformers version 4.40.2. Ensure your environment meets this requirement.

## Step 5: Install Additional Python Libraries

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```txt
notebook
numpy 
scipy 
scikit-learn 
matplotlib 
pandas 
pillow 
graphviz
```

Then install all packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 6: Install Node Version Manager (NVM)

We need Node.js for some development tools. NVM makes it easy to manage multiple Node.js versions.

1. **Install NVM for Windows**:

   ```bash
   winget install -e --id CoreyButler.NVMforWindows
   ```

2. **Install and Use Node.js 18.20**:

   ```bash
   nvm install 18.20.0
   nvm use 18.20.0
   ```

## Step 7: Install VS Code Development Support

Install Yeoman and the VS Code extension generator:

```bash
npm install --global yo generator-code
```

## Verification Checklist

Before proceeding to Lab 1, verify your setup:

- [ ] Python 3.11.8 environment created and activated
- [ ] Prompt Flow SDK installed (`pf --version` works)
- [ ] VS Code Prompt Flow extension installed
- [ ] All Python requirements installed
- [ ] Node.js 18.20.0 installed and active
- [ ] Yeoman and VS Code generator installed

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If `conda` commands fail, ensure Miniforge is properly installed and PowerShell is running as administrator
- If `pip` installations fail, try upgrading pip first: `pip install --upgrade pip`
- For NPU library issues, check your Transformers version: `pip show transformers`

## Next Steps

Congratulations! Your development environment is now ready. In the next lab, you'll begin working with Prompt Flow to create your first AI workflow.

> **Note**: Keep your `pyenv` environment activated for all subsequent labs. You can reactivate it anytime with `conda activate pyenv`.
