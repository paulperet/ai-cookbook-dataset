## Basic Multi-LLM Workflows

This notebook demonstrates three simple multi-LLM workflows. They trade off cost or latency for potentially improved task performances:

1. **Prompt-Chaining**: Decomposes a task into sequential subtasks, where each step builds on previous results
2. **Parallelization**: Distributes independent subtasks across multiple LLMs for concurrent processing
3. **Routing**: Dynamically selects specialized LLM paths based on input characteristics

Note: These are sample implementations meant to demonstrate core concepts - not production code.

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

from util import extract_xml, llm_call
```

```python
def chain(input: str, prompts: list[str]) -> str:
    """Chain multiple LLM calls sequentially, passing results between steps."""
    result = input
    for i, prompt in enumerate(prompts, 1):
        print(f"\nStep {i}:")
        result = llm_call(f"{prompt}\nInput: {result}")
        print(result)
    return result


def parallel(prompt: str, inputs: list[str], n_workers: int = 3) -> list[str]:
    """Process multiple inputs concurrently with the same prompt."""
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=n_workers) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(llm_call, f"{prompt}\nInput: {x}") for x in inputs]
        return [f.result() for f in futures]


def route(input: str, routes: dict[str, str]) -> str:
    """Route input to specialized prompt using content classification."""
    # First determine appropriate route using LLM with chain-of-thought
    print(f"\nAvailable routes: {list(routes.keys())}")
    selector_prompt = f"""
    Analyze the input and select the most appropriate support team from these options: {list(routes.keys())}
    First explain your reasoning, then provide your selection in this XML format:

    <reasoning>
    Brief explanation of why this ticket should be routed to a specific team.
    Consider key terms, user intent, and urgency level.
    </reasoning>

    <selection>
    The chosen team name
    </selection>

    Input: {input}""".strip()

    route_response = llm_call(selector_prompt)
    reasoning = extract_xml(route_response, "reasoning")
    route_key = extract_xml(route_response, "selection").strip().lower()

    print("Routing Analysis:")
    print(reasoning)
    print(f"\nSelected route: {route_key}")

    # Process input with selected specialized prompt
    selected_prompt = routes[route_key]
    return llm_call(f"{selected_prompt}\nInput: {input}")
```

## Example Usage

Below are practical examples demonstrating each workflow:
1. Chain workflow for structured data extraction and formatting
2. Parallelization workflow for stakeholder impact analysis
3. Route workflow for customer support ticket handling

```python
# Example 1: Chain workflow for structured data extraction and formatting
# Each step progressively transforms raw text into a formatted table

data_processing_steps = [
    """Extract only the numerical values and their associated metrics from the text.
    Format each as 'value: metric' on a new line.
    Example format:
    92: customer satisfaction
    45%: revenue growth""",
    """Convert all numerical values to percentages where possible.
    If not a percentage or points, convert to decimal (e.g., 92 points -> 92%).
    Keep one number per line.
    Example format:

    45%: revenue growth""",
    """Sort all lines in descending order by numerical value.
    Keep the format 'value: metric' on each line.
    Example:
    92%: customer satisfaction
    87%: employee satisfaction""",
    """Format the sorted data as a markdown table with columns:
    | Metric | Value |
    |:--|--:|
    | Customer Satisfaction | 92% |""",
]

    Available routes: ['billing', 'technical', 'account', 'product']
    Routing Analysis:
    
    This issue is clearly related to account access and authentication problems. The user is experiencing login difficulties with their password, which is a core account security and access issue. While there might be technical aspects involved, the primary concern is account access restoration. The urgency mentioned by the user and the nature of the problem (password/login issues) makes this a typical account support case. Account team specialists are best equipped to handle password resets, account verification, and access restoration procedures.
    
    
    Selected route: account
    Account Support Response:
    
    Dear John,
    
    I understand your urgency regarding account access. Before proceeding with account recovery, we must verify your identity to maintain security protocols.
    
    Immediate Steps for Account Recovery:
    1. Visit our secure password reset page at [secure portal URL]
    2. Click "Forgot Password"
    3. Enter your
