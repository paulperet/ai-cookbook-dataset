# Speculative Prompt Caching

This cookbook demonstrates "Speculative Prompt Caching" - a pattern that reduces time-to-first-token (TTFT) by warming up the cache while users are still formulating their queries.

**Without Speculative Caching:**
1. User types their question (3 seconds)
2. User submits question
3. API loads context into cache AND generates response

**With Speculative Caching:**
1. User starts typing (cache warming begins immediately)
2. User continues typing (cache warming completes in background)
3. User submits question
4. API uses warm cache to generate response

## Setup

First, let's install the required packages:

```python
%pip install anthropic httpx --quiet
```

```python
import asyncio
import copy
import datetime
import time

import httpx
from anthropic import AsyncAnthropic

# Configuration constants
MODEL = "claude-sonnet-4-5"
SQLITE_SOURCES = {
    "btree.h": "https://sqlite.org/src/raw/18e5e7b2124c23426a283523e5f31a4bff029131b795bb82391f9d2f3136fc50?at=btree.h",
    "btree.c": "https://sqlite.org/src/raw/63ca6b647342e8cef643863cd0962a542f133e1069460725ba4461dcda92b03c?at=btree.c",
}
DEFAULT_CLIENT_ARGS = {
    "system": "You are an expert systems programmer helping analyze database internals.",
    "max_tokens": 4096,
    "temperature": 0,
}
```

## Helper Functions

Let's set up the functions to download our large context and prepare messages:

```python
async def get_sqlite_sources() -> dict[str, str]:
    print("Downloading SQLite source files...")

    source_files = {}
    start_time = time.time()

    async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=30.0) as client:
        tasks = []

        async def download_file(filename: str, url: str) -> tuple[str, str]:
            response = await client.get(url, follow_redirects=True)
            response.raise_for_status()
            print(f"Successfully downloaded {filename}")
            return filename, response.text

        for filename, url in SQLITE_SOURCES.items():
            tasks.append(download_file(filename, url))

        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        source_files = dict(results)

    duration = time.time() - start_time
    print(f"Downloaded {len(source_files)} files in {duration:.2f} seconds")
    return source_files


async def create_initial_message():
    sources = await get_sqlite_sources()
    # Prepare the initial message with the source code as context.
    # A Timestamp is included to prevent cache sharing across different runs.
    initial_message = {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": f"""
Current time: {datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")}

Source to Analyze:

btree.h:
```c
{sources["btree.h"]}
```

btree.c:
```c
{sources["btree.c"]}
```""",
                "cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"},
            }
        ],
    }
    return initial_message


async def sample_one_token(client: AsyncAnthropic, messages: list):
    """Send a single-token request to warm up the cache"""
    args = copy.deepcopy(DEFAULT_CLIENT_ARGS)
    args["max_tokens"] = 1
    await client.messages.create(
        messages=messages,
        model=MODEL,
        **args,
    )


def print_query_statistics(response, query_type: str) -> None:
    print(f"\n{query_type} query statistics:")
    print(f"\tInput tokens: {response.usage.input_tokens}")
    print(f"\tOutput tokens: {response.usage.output_tokens}")
    print(f"\tCache read input tokens: {getattr(response.usage, 'cache_read_input_tokens', '---')}")
    print(
        f"\tCache creation input tokens: {getattr(response.usage, 'cache_creation_input_tokens', '---')}"
    )
```

## Example 1: Standard Prompt Caching (Without Speculative Caching)

First, let's see how standard prompt caching works. The user types their question, then we send the entire context + question to the API:

```python
async def standard_prompt_caching_demo():
    client = AsyncAnthropic()

    # Prepare the large context
    initial_message = await create_initial_message()

    # Simulate user typing time (in real app, this would be actual user input)
    print("User is typing their question...")
    await asyncio.sleep(3)  # Simulate 3 seconds of typing
    user_question = "What is the purpose of the BtShared structure?"
    print(f"User submitted: {user_question}")

    # Now send the full request (context + question)
    full_message = copy.deepcopy(initial_message)
    full_message["content"].append(
        {"type": "text", "text": f"Answer the user's question: {user_question}"}
    )

    print("\nSending request to API...")
    start_time = time.time()

    # Measure time to first token
    first_token_time = None
    async with client.messages.stream(
        messages=[full_message],
        model=MODEL,
        **DEFAULT_CLIENT_ARGS,
    ) as stream:
        async for text in stream.text_stream:
            if first_token_time is None and text.strip():
                first_token_time = time.time() - start_time
                print(f"\n🕐 Time to first token: {first_token_time:.2f} seconds")
                break

        # Get the full response
        response = await stream.get_final_message()

    total_time = time.time() - start_time
    print(f"Total response time: {total_time:.2f} seconds")
    print_query_statistics(response, "Standard Caching")

    return first_token_time, total_time
```

```python
# Run the standard demo
standard_ttft, standard_total = await standard_prompt_caching_demo()
```

## Example 2: Speculative Prompt Caching

Now let's see how speculative prompt caching improves TTFT by warming the cache while the user is typing:

```python
async def speculative_prompt_caching_demo():
    client = AsyncAnthropic()

    # The user has a large amount of context they want to interact with,
    # in this case it's the sqlite b-tree implementation (~150k tokens).
    initial_message = await create_initial_message()

    # Start speculative caching while user is typing
    print("User is typing their question...")
    print("🔥 Starting cache warming in background...")

    # While the user is typing out their question, we sample a single token
    # from the context the user is going to be interacting with with explicit
    # prompt caching turned on to warm up the cache.
    cache_task = asyncio.create_task(sample_one_token(client, [initial_message]))

    # Simulate user typing time
    await asyncio.sleep(3)  # Simulate 3 seconds of typing
    user_question = "What is the purpose of the BtShared structure?"
    print(f"User submitted: {user_question}")

    # Ensure cache warming is complete
    await cache_task
    print("✅ Cache warming completed!")

    # Prepare messages for cached query. We make sure we
    # reuse the same initial message as was cached to ensure we have a cache hit.
    cached_message = copy.deepcopy(initial_message)
    cached_message["content"].append(
        {"type": "text", "text": f"Answer the user's question: {user_question}"}
    )

    print("\nSending request to API (with warm cache)...")
    start_time = time.time()

    # Measure time to first token
    first_token_time = None
    async with client.messages.stream(
        messages=[cached_message],
        model=MODEL,
        **DEFAULT_CLIENT_ARGS,
    ) as stream:
        async for text in stream.text_stream:
            if first_token_time is None and text.strip():
                first_token_time = time.time() - start_time
                print(f"\n🚀 Time to first token: {first_token_time:.2f} seconds")
                break

        # Get the full response
        response = await stream.get_final_message()

    total_time = time.time() - start_time
    print(f"Total response time: {total_time:.2f} seconds")
    print_query_statistics(response, "Speculative Caching")

    return first_token_time, total_time
```

```python
# Run the speculative caching demo
speculative_ttft, speculative_total = await speculative_prompt_caching_demo()
```

## Performance Comparison

Let's compare the results to see the benefit of speculative caching:

```python
print("=" * 60)
print("PERFORMANCE COMPARISON")
print("=" * 60)

print("\nStandard Prompt Caching:")
print(f"  Time to First Token: {standard_ttft:.2f} seconds")
print(f"  Total Response Time: {standard_total:.2f} seconds")

print("\nSpeculative Prompt Caching:")
print(f"  Time to First Token: {speculative_ttft:.2f} seconds")
print(f"  Total Response Time: {speculative_total:.2f} seconds")

ttft_improvement = (standard_ttft - speculative_ttft) / standard_ttft * 100
total_improvement = (standard_total - speculative_total) / standard_total * 100

print("\n🎯 IMPROVEMENTS:")
print(
    f"  TTFT Improvement: {ttft_improvement:.1f}% ({standard_ttft - speculative_ttft:.2f}s faster)"
)
print(
    f"  Total Time Improvement: {total_improvement:.1f}% ({standard_total - speculative_total:.2f}s faster)"
)
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Speculative caching dramatically reduces TTFT** by warming the cache while users are typing
2. **The pattern is most effective** with large contexts (>1000 tokens) that are reused across queries
3. **Implementation is simple** - just send a 1-token request while the user is typing
4. **Cache warming happens in parallel** with user input, effectively "hiding" the cache creation time

## Best Practices

- Start cache warming as early as possible (e.g., when a user focuses an input field)
- Use exactly the same context for warming and actual requests to ensure cache hits
- Monitor `cache_read_input_tokens` to verify cache hits
- Add timestamps to prevent unwanted cache sharing across sessions
