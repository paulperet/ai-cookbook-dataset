# Orchestrator-Workers Workflow

## Introduction

Have you ever needed multiple perspectives on the same task, but couldn't predict in advance which perspectives would be most valuable? The orchestrator-workers pattern solves this by having a central LLM analyze each unique task and dynamically determine the best subtasks to delegate to specialized worker LLMs.

Traditional approaches either require manual prompting multiple times or use hardcoded parallelization that generates the same variations regardless of context.

With this approach, an orchestrator LLM analyzes the task, determines which variations would be most valuable for this specific case, then delegates to worker LLMs that generate each variation.

### What You'll Build

A system that takes a product description request and:

1. Analyzes what types of marketing copy would be valuable
2. Dynamically generates specialized task descriptions for workers
3. Produces multiple content variations optimized for different audiences
4. Returns coordinated results from all workers

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Anthropic API key set as environment variable: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key'`
- Basic understanding of prompt engineering
- Familiarity with Python classes and type hints


### When to use this workflow

This workflow is well-suited for complex tasks where you can't predict the subtasks needed in advance. The key difference from simple parallelization is its flexibility—subtasks aren't pre-defined, but determined by the orchestrator based on the specific input.

**Use this pattern when:**

- Tasks require multiple distinct approaches or perspectives
- The optimal subtasks depend on the specific input
- You need to compare different strategies or styles

**Don't use this pattern when:**

- You have simple, single-output tasks (unnecessary complexity)
- Latency is critical (multiple LLM calls add overhead)
- Subtasks are predictable and can be pre-defined (use simpler parallelization)

## How It Works

The orchestrator-workers pattern operates in two phases:

1. **Analysis & Planning Phase**: The orchestrator LLM receives the task and context, analyzes what approaches would be valuable, and generates structured subtask descriptions in XML format.

2. **Execution Phase**: Each worker LLM receives:
   - The original task for context
   - Its specific subtask type and description
   - Any additional context provided

The orchestrator decides *at runtime* what subtasks to create, making this more adaptive than pre-defined parallel workflows.

## Setup

### Installation
```bash
pip install anthropic
```

### Helper Functions
This example uses helper functions from `util.py` for making LLM calls and parsing XML responses:

- `llm_call(prompt, system_prompt="", model="claude-sonnet-4-5")`: Sends a prompt to Claude and returns the text response
- `extract_xml(text, tag)`: Extracts content from XML tags using regex

These utilities handle API authentication (reading `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from environment) and provide a simple interface for the orchestrator-workers pattern. You can view the complete implementation in [util.py](util.py).

## Implementation

The `FlexibleOrchestrator` class coordinates the two-phase workflow:

**Key design decisions:**
- Prompts are templates that accept runtime variables (`task`, `context`) for flexibility
- XML is used for structured output parsing (reliable and language-model-friendly format)
- Workers receive both the original task AND their specific instructions for better context
- Error handling validates that workers return non-empty responses

The implementation includes:
- `parse_tasks()`: Parses the orchestrator's XML output into structured task dictionaries
- `FlexibleOrchestrator.process()`: Main coordination logic that calls orchestrator, then workers
- Response validation to catch and handle empty worker outputs


```python
from util import extract_xml, llm_call

# Model configuration
MODEL = "claude-sonnet-4-5"  # Fast, capable model for both orchestrator and workers


def parse_tasks(tasks_xml: str) -> list[dict]:
    """Parse XML tasks into a list of task dictionaries."""
    tasks = []
    current_task = {}

    for line in tasks_xml.split("\n"):
        line = line.strip()
        if not line:
            continue

        if line.startswith("<task>"):
            current_task = {}
        elif line.startswith("<type>"):
            current_task["type"] = line[6:-7].strip()
        elif line.startswith("<description>"):
            current_task["description"] = line[12:-13].strip()
        elif line.startswith("</task>"):
            if "description" in current_task:
                if "type" not in current_task:
                    current_task["type"] = "default"
                tasks.append(current_task)

## Example Use Case: Marketing Variation Generation

Now let's see the orchestrator-workers pattern in action with a practical example: generating multiple styles of marketing copy for a product.

**Why this example demonstrates the pattern well:**
- Different products benefit from different marketing angles
- The "best" variations depend on the specific product features and target audience
- The orchestrator can adapt its strategy based on the input rather than using a fixed template

**Prompt design notes:**
- The orchestrator prompt asks for 2-3 approaches and provides XML structure guidance
- The worker prompt gives workers full context (original task, their style, and guidelines)
- Both prompts use clear XML formatting to ensure reliable parsing


```python
ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT = """
Analyze this task and break it down into 2-3 distinct approaches:

Task: {task}

Return your response in this format:

<analysis>
Explain your understanding of the task and which variations would be valuable.
Focus on how each approach serves different aspects of the task.
</analysis>

    This task requires creating marketing copy for an eco-friendly water bottle. The core challenge is balancing product information with persuasive messaging while highlighting the environmental benefits. Different approaches would serve distinct marketing channels and audience segments:
    
    1. A **feature-focused technical approach** would appeal to detail-oriented consumers who make purchasing decisions based on specifications, materials, and measurable environmental impact. This serves e-commerce listings and comparison shopping.
    
    2. A **lifestyle-oriented emotional approach** would connect with values-driven consumers through storytelling and aspirational messaging, emphasizing how the product fits into an eco-conscious lifestyle. This serves social media and brand-building content.
    
    3. A **benefit-driven practical approach** would focus on solving everyday problems while weaving in sustainability advantages, appealing to mainstream consumers who want both functionality and environmental responsibility. This serves broad retail contexts.
    
    Each approach addresses the "eco-friendly" aspect differently—through data, values, or practical advantages—making them valuable for different marketing contexts.

    **More Than Hydration. A Daily Ritual of Change.**
    
    Every morning, you make a choice. Not just about what you drink, but about who you are and the world you're creating.
    
    This isn't just a water bottle—it's your companion in a quiet revolution. Crafted from 100% recycled ocean-bound plastic, each bottle tells a story of transformation: waste that once threatened our seas, now reimagined as something beautiful, functional, and enduring in your hands.
    
    Feel the smooth, cool surface against your palm. Notice its weight—substantial enough to remind you it's built to last decades, not days. This is the bottle that replaces hundreds of single-use plastics, the one that travels with you through morning commutes, mountain trails, and late-night creative sessions. It becomes part of your story, collecting scratches and memories like badges of honor.
    
    But here's what really matters: You're not alone in this. You're joining millions who understand that sustainability isn't about perfection—it's about progress. Every refill is a small act of defiance against throwaway culture. Every sip connects you to a global community choosing differently, living intentionally
