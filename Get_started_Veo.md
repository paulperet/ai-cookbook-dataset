# Get started with Video generation using Veo

_If you're reading this notebook on Github, open it in Colab by clicking the above button to see the generated videos._

⚠️ Veo is a paid only feature. This notebook won't run with the Free Tier. (cf. pricing for more details).


```
# Change that value if you want to run the colab
I_am_aware_that_veo_is_a_paid_feature = False # @param {type:"boolean"}
```

## What's Veo?

Veo enables creators to create high quality videos with incredible detail, minimal artifacts, and extended durations in resolutions up to 1080p. Veo supports both text-to-video and images-to-video.

With [Veo 3](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/video), you can create videos with:
* **Advanced language understanding**: Veo deeply understands natural language and visual semantics, capturing the nuance and tone of complex prompts to render intricate details in extended scenes, including cinematic terms like "timelapse" or "aerial shots."
* **Unprecedented creative control**: Veo provides an unprecedented level of creative control, understanding prompts for all kinds of cinematic effects, like timelapses or aerial shots of a landscape.
* **Videos with audio**: Veo 3 generates videos with audio automatically, with no additional effort from the developer.
* **More accurate video controls**: Veo 3 is more accurate on lighting, accurate physics, and camera controls.

**Veo 3.1** brings new capabilities:
* **Starting and ending frames**: Control how the video starts... and ends! ([jump directly to this part](#last_frame))
* **Image-based direction**: Give up to 3 references to Veo (character, locations, props...) and let it create a video using them ([jump directly to this part](#r2v))
* **Extend videos**: Add 7s more second to your videos up to 141 seconds long ones. ([jump directly to this part](#extend))

The Veo 3 family of models includes both [**Veo 3/3.1**](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/video?example=dialogue#veo-3) as well as [**Veo 3/3.1 Fast**](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/video?example=dialogue#veo-3-fast), which are a faster and more accessible version of the models. The Veo Fast models are ideal for backend services that programmatically generate ads, tools for rapid A/B testing of creative concepts, or apps that need to quickly produce social media content.

**Safety is a core focus**, with robust measures to prevent inappropriate or harmful content, and all generated videos are digitally watermarked with [Google DeepMind’s SynthID](https://deepmind.google/science/synthid/).

Note that the previous model generation, [**Veo 2**](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/video?example=dialogue#veo-2), is still available for developers via the Gemini API for a while. However, unlike Veo 3, videos generated by Veo 2 do not contain audio.

# Setup

### Install SDK

Install the SDK from [PyPI](https://github.com/googleapis/python-genai).


```
%pip install -U -q "google-genai>=1.44.0" # Minimum version 1.44 for video extension
```

[..., Last Entry]

### Setup your API key and initialize client

To run the following cell, your API key must be stored it in a Colab Secret named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. If you don't already have an API key, or you're not sure how to create a Colab Secret, see [Authentication](../quickstarts/Authentication.ipynb) for an example.


```
from google.colab import userdata
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

GEMINI_API_KEY = userdata.get('GEMINI_API_KEY')
client = genai.Client(api_key=GEMINI_API_KEY)
```

### Select the Veo model


```
VEO_MODEL_ID = "veo-3.1-fast-generate-preview" # @param ['veo-3.0-fast-generate-001', 'veo-3.0-generate-001', 'veo-3.1-fast-generate-preview', 'veo-3.1-generate-preview'] {"allow-input":true, isTemplate: true}
```

# Text-to-video

Describe your desired scene, whether crafted by you or with Gemini's assistance, and Veo 3 brings it to life.

### Prompting Tips for Veo
To get the most out of Veo, consider incorporating specific video terminology into your prompts.  Veo understands a wide range of terms related to:

* **Shot composition**: Specify the framing and number of subjects in the shot (e.g., "*single shot*", "*two shot*", "*over-the-shoulder shot*").
* **Camera positioning and movement**:  Control the camera's location and movement using terms like "*eye level*", "*high angle*", "*worms eye*", "*dolly shot*", "*zoom shot*", "*pan shot," and "*tracking shot*".
* **Focus and lens effects**:  Use terms like "*shallow focus*", "*deep focus*", "*soft focus*", "*macro lens*", and "*wide-angle lens*" to achieve specific visual effects.
* **Overall style and subject**: Guide Veo's creative direction by specifying styles like "*sci-fi*", "*romantic comedy*", "*action movie*" or "*animation*". You can also describe the subjects and backgrounds you want, such as "*cityscape*", "*nature*", "*vehicles*", or "animals."

Check the [Veo prompt guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/video#prompt-guide) for more details and tips.


### Optional parameters
The prompt is the only mandatory parameters, the others are all optional.

* **negative_prompt**: What you don't want to see in the video,
* **person_generation**: Tell you model if it's allowed to generate adults in the videos or not. Children are always blocked,
* **duration_seconds**: 4, 6 or 8s with Veo 3.1 (always 8s for Veo 3 and 7s when extending)
* **aspect ratio**: Either `16:9` (landscape) or `9:16` (portrait),
* **resolution**: Either `720p` or `1080p`

More details about each parameters in the related section of the [documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/video#veo-model-parameters).

### Create a video from a simple text prompt

It takes about a minute for the video to be generated.


```
if not I_am_aware_that_veo_is_a_paid_feature:
  print("Veo is a paid feature. Please change the variable 'I_am_aware_that_veo_is_a_paid_feature' to True if you are okay with paying to run it.")

else:

  # Optional parameters
  negative_prompt = "barking, woofing" # @param {type: "string"}
  aspect_ratio = "16:9" # @param ["16:9","9:16"]
  resolution = "1080p" # @param ["720p","1080p"]

  operation = client.models.generate_videos(
      model=VEO_MODEL_ID,
      prompt=prompt,
      config=types.GenerateVideosConfig(
        aspect_ratio=aspect_ratio,

##### Watch a sample generation 🎥

🍿 The video you will generate will be similar to this: [A golden retriever playing in a field of sunflowers](https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/gemini-cookbook/videos/dog_sunflowers.mp4).

### Select your resolution and aspect ratio

For landscape videos, you can select either the `720p` or the `1080p` resolutions. But if you prefer a vertical video you can set the `aspect_ratio` to `9:16` and get a portrait video.

Begin with a high-angle drone shot that slowly descends, transitioning into a close-up, low-angle tracking shot that perfectly follows the car as it rounds a curve, emphasizing its speed and the gleam of its paint under the fading light. Then, execute a smooth, rapid dolly zoom, making the background compress as the car remains the same size, conveying a sense of intense focus and speed. Finally, end with a perfectly stable, slow-motion shot from a fixed roadside perspective as the car blurs past, its taillights streaking across the frame.
