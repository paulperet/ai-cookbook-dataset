# How to evaluate a summarization task

In this notebook we delve into the evaluation techniques for abstractive summarization tasks using a simple example. We explore traditional evaluation methods like [ROUGE](https://aclanthology.org/W04-1013/) and [BERTScore](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09675), in addition to showcasing a more novel approach using LLMs as evaluators.

Evaluating the quality of summaries is a time-consuming process, as it involves different quality metrics such as coherence, conciseness, readability and content. Traditional automatic evaluation metrics such as `ROUGE` and `BERTScore` and others are concrete and reliable, but they may not correlate well with the actual quality of summaries. They show relatively low correlation with human judgments, especially for open-ended generation tasks ([Liu et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16634.pdf)). There's a growing need to lean on human evaluations, user feedback, or model-based metrics while being vigilant about potential biases. While human judgment provides invaluable insights, it is often not scalable and can be cost-prohibitive.

In addition to these traditional metrics, we showcase a method ([G-Eval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16634.pdf)) that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a novel, reference-free metric for assessing abstractive summaries. In this case, we use `gpt-4` to score candidate outputs. `gpt-4` has effectively learned an internal model of language quality that allows it to differentiate between fluent, coherent text and low-quality text. Harnessing this internal scoring mechanism allows auto-evaluation of new candidate outputs generated by an LLM.


## Setup



```python
# Installing necessary packages for the evaluation
# rouge: For evaluating with ROUGE metric
# bert_score: For evaluating with BERTScore
# openai: To interact with OpenAI's API
!pip install rouge --quiet
!pip install bert_score --quiet
!pip install openai --quiet
```


```python
from openai import OpenAI
import os
import re
import pandas as pd

# Python Implementation of the ROUGE Metric
from rouge import Rouge

# BERTScore leverages the pre-trained contextual embeddings from BERT and matches words in candidate and reference sentences by cosine similarity.
from bert_score import BERTScorer

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "<your OpenAI API key if not set as env var>"))

```

## Example task

For the purposes of this notebook we'll use the example summarization below. Notice that we provide two generated summaries to compare, and a reference human-written summary, which evaluation metrics like `ROUGE` and `BERTScore` require.

Excerpt (`excerpt`):

> OpenAI's mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. OpenAI will build safe and beneficial AGI directly, but will also consider its mission fulfilled if its work aids others to achieve this outcome. OpenAI follows several key principles for this purpose. First, broadly distributed benefits - any influence over AGI's deployment will be used for the benefit of all, and to avoid harmful uses or undue concentration of power. Second, long-term safety - OpenAI is committed to doing the research to make AGI safe, and to promote the adoption of such research across the AI community. Third, technical leadership - OpenAI aims to be at the forefront of AI capabilities. Fourth, a cooperative orientation - OpenAI actively cooperates with other research and policy institutions, and seeks to create a global community working together to address AGI's global challenges.

## Evaluating using ROUGE

[ROUGE](https://aclanthology.org/W04-1013/), which stands for Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, primarily gauges the overlap of words between a generated output and a reference text. It's a prevalent metric for evaluating automatic summarization tasks. Among its variants, `ROUGE-L` offers insights into the longest contiguous match between system-generated and reference summaries, gauging how well the system retains the original summary's essence.



```python
# function to calculate the Rouge score
def get_rouge_scores(text1, text2):
    rouge = Rouge()
    return rouge.get_scores(text1, text2)


rouge_scores_out = []

# Calculate the ROUGE scores for both summaries using reference
eval_1_rouge = get_rouge_scores(eval_summary_1, ref_summary)
eval_2_rouge = get_rouge_scores(eval_summary_2, ref_summary)

for metric in ["rouge-1", "rouge-2", "rouge-l"]:
    for label in ["F-Score"]:
        eval_1_score = eval_1_rouge[0][metric][label[0].lower()]
        eval_2_score = eval_2_rouge[0][metric][label[0].lower()]

        row = {
            "Metric": f"{metric} ({label})",
            "Summary 1": eval_1_score,
            "Summary 2": eval_2_score,
        }
        rouge_scores_out.append(row)


def highlight_max(s):
    is_max = s == s.max()
    return [
        "background-color: lightgreen" if v else "background-color: white"
        for v in is_max
    ]


rouge_scores_out = (
    pd.DataFrame(rouge_scores_out)
    .set_index("Metric")
    .style.apply(highlight_max, axis=1)
)

The table shows the `ROUGE` scores for evaluating two different summaries against a reference text. In the case of `rouge-1`, Summary 2 outperforms Summary 1, indicating a better overlap of individual words and for `rouge-l`, Summary 2 has a higher score, implying a closer match in the longest common subsequences, and thus a potentially better overall summarization in capturing the main content and order of the original text. Since Summary 2 has many words and short phrases directly lifted from the excerpt, its overlap with the reference summary would likely be higher, leading to higher `ROUGE` scores.

While `ROUGE` and similar metrics, such as [BLEU](https://aclanthology.org/P02-1040.pdf) and [METEOR](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~alavie/METEOR/), offer quantitative measures, they often fail to capture the true essence of a well-generated summary. They also correlate worse with human scores. Given the advancements in LLMs, which are adept at producing fluent and coherent summaries, traditional metrics like `ROUGE` may inadvertently penalize these models. This is especially true if the summaries are articulated differently but still encapsulate the core information accurately.


## Evaluating using BERTScore

ROUGE relies on the exact presence of words in both the predicted and reference texts, failing to interpret the underlying semantics. This is where [BERTScore](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09675) comes in and leverages the contextual embeddings from the BERT model, aiming to evaluate the similarity between a predicted and a reference sentence in the context of machine-generated text. By comparing embeddings from both sentences, `BERTScore` captures semantic similarities that might be missed by traditional n-gram based metrics.



```python
# Instantiate the BERTScorer object for English language
scorer = BERTScorer(lang="en")

# Calculate BERTScore for the summary 1 against the excerpt
# P1, R1, F1_1 represent Precision, Recall, and F1 Score respectively
P1, R1, F1_1 = scorer.score([eval_summary_1], [ref_summary])

# Calculate BERTScore for summary 2 against the excerpt
# P2, R2, F2_2 represent Precision, Recall, and F1 Score respectively
P2, R2, F2_2 = scorer.score([eval_summary_2], [ref_summary])

print("Summary 1 F1 Score:", F1_1.tolist()[0])
print("Summary 2 F1 Score:", F2_2.tolist()[0])
```

    Some weights of the model checkpoint at roberta-large were not used when initializing RobertaModel: ['lm_head.dense.weight', 'lm_head.dense.bias', 'lm_head.layer_norm.bias', 'lm_head.layer_norm.weight', 'lm_head.decoder.weight', 'lm_head.bias']
    - This IS expected if you are initializing RobertaModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
    - This IS NOT expected if you are initializing RobertaModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).


    Summary 1 F1 Score: 0.9227314591407776
    Summary 2 F1 Score: 0.9189572930335999


The close F1 Scores between the summaries indicate that they may perform similarly in capturing the key information. However, this small difference should be interpreted with caution. Since `BERTScore` may not fully grasp subtleties and high-level concepts that a human evaluator might understand, reliance solely on this metric could lead to misinterpreting the actual quality and nuances of the summary. An integrated approach combining `BERTScore` with human judgment and other metrics could offer a more reliable evaluation.


## Evaluating using GPT-4

Here we implement an example **reference-free** text evaluator using `gpt-4`, inspired by the [G-Eval]((https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16634.pdf)) framework which evaluates the quality of generated text using large language models. Unlike metrics like `ROUGE` or `BERTScore` that rely on comparison to reference summaries, the `gpt-4` based evaluator assesses the quality of generated content based solely on the input prompt and text, without any ground truth references. This makes it applicable to new datasets and tasks where human references are sparse or unavailable. 

Here's an overview of this method:

1. We define four distinct criteria:
    1. **Relevance**: Evaluates if the summary includes only important information and excludes redundancies.
    2. **Coherence**: Assesses the logical flow and organization of the summary.
    3. **Consistency**: Checks if the summary aligns with the facts in the source document.
    4. **Fluency**: Rates the grammar and readability of the summary.
2. We craft prompts for each of these criteria, taking the original document and the summary as inputs, and leveraging chain-of-thought generation and guiding the model to output a numeric score from 1-5 for each criteria. 
3. We generate scores from `gpt-4` with the defined prompts, comparing them across summaries.

In this demonstration, we're using a direct scoring function where `gpt-4` generates a discrete score (1-5) for each metric. Normalizing the scores and taking a weighted sum could result in more robust, continuous scores that better reflect the quality and diversity of the summaries.
