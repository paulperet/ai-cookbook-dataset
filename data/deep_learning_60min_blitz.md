# PyTorch 60-Minute Blitz: A Quick-Start Guide

## Overview

This guide provides a rapid introduction to PyTorch, a powerful Python library for deep learning and scientific computing. You'll learn the fundamentals of PyTorch's core components and build a complete neural network for image classification.

### What You'll Learn
- **PyTorch Tensors**: The foundational data structure for all computations
- **Automatic Differentiation**: How PyTorch automatically computes gradients for training
- **Neural Network Construction**: Building and training neural networks with PyTorch
- **Image Classification**: Applying your knowledge to train a classifier on the CIFAR10 dataset

### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
```

## Tutorial Structure

This guide is organized into four sequential tutorials. Follow them in order for the best learning experience:

### 1. **Tensors: The Building Blocks**
Learn the basics of PyTorch tensors - the fundamental data structure that powers all PyTorch computations. You'll discover how tensors differ from NumPy arrays and how to leverage GPU acceleration.

### 2. **Automatic Differentiation with torch.autograd**
Understand PyTorch's automatic differentiation system, which automatically computes gradients for neural network training. This is essential for implementing backpropagation efficiently.

### 3. **Building Neural Networks**
Learn how to construct, train, and evaluate neural networks using PyTorch's `nn` module. You'll build a complete neural network from scratch.

### 4. **Training an Image Classifier**
Apply your knowledge to train a convolutional neural network on the CIFAR10 dataset. This practical tutorial covers data loading, training loops, and model evaluation.

## Getting Started

Each tutorial builds upon the previous one, so it's recommended to complete them in order. The tutorials are designed to be completed in approximately 60 minutes total, though you may want to spend more time experimenting with the code examples.
