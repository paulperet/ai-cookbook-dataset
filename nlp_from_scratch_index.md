# NLP from Scratch

In these three-part series you will build and train a basic
character-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to classify words.

You will learn:

-   How to construct Recurrent Neural Networks from scratch
-   Essential data handling techniques for NLP
-   How to train an RNN to identify the language origin of words.

Before you begin, we recommend that you review the following:

    series](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html)
-   [How to install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
